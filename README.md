  # Welcome to my Github
  
  I'm a SecDevOps Engineer/Team Lead depending on what the situation calls for. I've worked as Director of IT for non-profits, operated a local B2B datacenter, and have worked with a few open souce organizations such as [Page DAO](https://github.com/PageDAO) and [PizzaDAO](https://github.com/PizzaDAO).
  
  While most of my contracting work is with companies developing internal propietary software, the open source ideoligies and hero's have always kept a special place in my heart.
